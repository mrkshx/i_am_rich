## Short Description

This is my first Mobile App I built with Flutter and Dart. 
It's just a simple app which just shows a diamond in the center.

### Hint

I created this app by the guidance of Angely Yu's Flutter Bootcamp on Appbrewery.co.

To follow the module easily I watched the course and rebuilt step by step what was explained. 
Knowing the importance of implementing feature in branches I refused to use branches while I was creating the apps in this course. 



## What I learnt

- basic structure of an app with Scaffold
- Centering content with Center widget
- adding a custom icon for Android and iOS
- using pubspec.yaml file to add images to the project
- using an image in the project
